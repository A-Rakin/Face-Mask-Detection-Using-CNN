I used the Dataset which I take from Kaggle.
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset

Here I use Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Network) with 3 input layer, 2 max pooling layer, 2 dropout layer, and 1 output layer. 

I comment all the necessary things in the notebook
